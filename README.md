Web3j Open API
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/web3j/web3j-openapi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/web3j/web3j-openapi)

Web3j-OpenAPI is an OpenAPI generator from solidity smart contracts. 

## Description 
Web3j-OpenAPI provides a way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain via simple and intuitive HTTP requests, abstracting the coding layer. These interactions can be done using plain HTTP requests or via the Swagger-UI, which is generated with every project.

The workflow can be summed in the following steps:
- Writing a solidity smart contract
- Generating the corresponding OpenAPI project using Web3j-OpenAPI
- Running the generated project
- Sending HTTP requests using Curls or Swagger-UI

**For more explanations**, a well detailed documentation and a sample project are on the way.
